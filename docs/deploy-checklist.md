sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.20.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Verify installations
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

- [ ] Docker Compose installed
- [ ] User added to docker group

### Step 2: Application Deployment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ws24dev.git
cd ws24dev

# Create production environment file
cp .env.example .env.prod
# Edit .env.prod with production values

# Create Docker secrets (see above)
# Build and start services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

- [ ] Repository cloned to production server
- [ ] Production environment file configured
- [ ] Docker secrets created
- [ ] Services built and started successfully

### Step 3: Database Setup

```bash
# Check database health
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec postgres pg_isready -U ws24user

# Run database migrations (if needed)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec app npm run db:migrate

# Verify database schema
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec postgres psql -U ws24user -d ws24_prod -c "\dt"
```

- [ ] Database container healthy
- [ ] Database migrations completed
- [ ] Database schema verified
- [ ] Initial data loaded (if applicable)

### Step 4: SSL/HTTPS Configuration

```bash
# Install certbot for Let's Encrypt
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Obtain SSL certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com

# Update nginx configuration for HTTPS
# Edit nginx/conf.d/ws24dev.conf to enable HTTPS section
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Application Won't Start**
```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs app

# Common causes:
# - Environment variables missing/incorrect
# - Database connection failed
# - Port conflicts
# - Permission issues
```

**Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL container
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec postgres pg_isready -U ws24user

# Check environment variables
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec app env | grep DATABASE_URL

# Check network connectivity
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec app ping postgres
```

**SSL Certificate Issues**
```bash
# Check certificate status
sudo certbot certificates

# Renew certificate manually
sudo certbot renew --dry-run

# Check nginx configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec nginx nginx -t
```

### Emergency Procedures

**Quick Rollback**
```bash
# Stop current deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Deploy previous version
git checkout previous-stable-tag
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

**Database Backup/Restore**
```bash
# Create backup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec postgres pg_dump -U ws24user ws24_prod > backup.sql

# Restore from backup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T postgres psql -U ws24user ws24_prod < backup.sql
```
